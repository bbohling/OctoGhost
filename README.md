# OctoGhost [![Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/jbrooksuk.png)](https://www.gittip.com/jbrooksuk/)

OctoGhost is a work in progress [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) post and tag converter.

## My Changes

* Added Marker to create the HTML
* The following data now gets inserted into db: updated_by, published_at, published_by, html
* Replaced image reference: `/uploads/` to `/content/images/`

## TODO

* Need to tweak the Markdown to HTML conversion, still some issues
* Figure out how to handle all the footnotes I currently have (Ghost does not currently support)
* More carefully review current conversion
